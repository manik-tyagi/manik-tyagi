## About Me - 😎

I'm a tech-obsessed engineering leader with ~20 years of experience and an insatiable curiosity for what's next. I thrive on building **scalable, cloud-native solutions**  But my real superpower? **Translating complex tech into plain English** for anyone, from junior developers to C-suite executives.  I believe in leading by example, strong collaboration, and clear communication. I love to see my teams succeed and believe that empathy goes a long way in building strong relationships. I'm also a big fan of making things efficient.

**Beyond the day job, I'm all-in on Generative AI.**  You'll often find me knee-deep in projects using **CrewAI**, **LangChain**, **LangGraph**, **LLaMA**, **OpenAI**, and other cutting-edge **ML** tools. 🤖 🧠 I love to explore, experiment and learn, and even more, to share what I discover.

**Why I'm on GitHub:**

-   🔥   **Learning, experimenting, and sharing my Gen AI journey.**
-   🕵️‍♂️  Exploring the world of **GraphQL** (especially **Apollo Federation**).
-   🏗️  Building with **AWS** (Lambda, DynamoDB, SQS - you name it!).
-   🤝  **Connecting** with other passionate technologists. I am an active participant in discussions and easy to work with.

Basically, I'm a lifelong learner who loves to build, explain, and connect.  If you're into any of the above, let's chat!
